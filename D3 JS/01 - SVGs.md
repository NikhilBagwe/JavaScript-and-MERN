## SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics :

- SVGs are used in websites to improve the user expereince and make the website responsive.
- Unlike normal images with .png, .jpg extensions get pixelated/blurred on zooming, SVG images stay intact.
- It is because, SVG image is defined using Maths and thus it can be easily scaled for any screen size.
- Note : Images are instructions/data for computer on how to color each pixel of the screen in memory.
- We provide the data/instructions in form of image to computer, then the computer processes on it and then the image is displayed.

- There are 2 types of graphics:
  1. Raster graphics - .jpd, .png - pixel defined
  2. Vector graphics - .svg - mathematically defined 
- For example, You capture an image from your mobile camera and your mobile display is of 1000 pixel. Later you open the same image on a 6000 pixel laptop screen. 
  Since the image is of 1000 pixel only, data/instructions for 5000 pixels remains.So the computer guesses the color data for remaining pixels and thus the image gets 
  pixelated/blurred.
- But in case of SVG, the image will be scaled depending on the screen size. Thus the image can be easily displayed on any screen size.
