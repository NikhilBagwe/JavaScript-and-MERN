## Intro :

- NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment which helps us to run JS outside the browser.

## Creating a NodeJS app :

```js
npm init
```
- Above command asks us for some information and then creates a package.json file.
- **package.json** file stores info about the whole project.
- Now create an index.js file and write some code inside it and that can be executed there itself in the terminal using "node index.js" cmd.
- So we didn't require browser to run JS.
