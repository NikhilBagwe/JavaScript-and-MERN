# Intro :

- Typescript is superset of Javascript.
- But it's not like it gives extra features to JS.
- TS allows you to write JS in a more precise manner so there are less errors at runtime.
- TS provides **TYPE SAFETY**

# Type Safety :

- JS allows us to add a variable of number data type with string which it shouldn't allow.

```js
console.log(2+'2');    // 22
```

- TS will allow you to stop this weird behaviour.
